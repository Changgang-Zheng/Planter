## Access to Planter Code

### Planter 0.1.0 has been released via [Link](https://github.com/In-Network-Machine-Learning/Planter) under [In-Network-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/In-Network-Machine-Learning).

## Introducing Planter
Planter is a modular framework for realizing one-click in-network machine learning algorithms. All you need to provide to Planter are a configuration file (```Name_data.py```) and a dataset. Planter will take it from there and offload your machine learning classification task into a programmable data plane. This is the artifact for the paper "Planter: Rapid Prototyping of In-Network Machine Learning Inference" in SIGCOMM CCR (with early [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.08824.pdf) version named "Automating In-Network Machine Learning".) 

ðŸ’¡ **Please check Planter's user document** [PDF](./Docs/Planter_User_Document_v0.1.0.pdf) (strongly recommended). 

## Planter's Availability

**Planter 0.1.0 has been released via [Link](https://github.com/In-Network-Machine-Learning/Planter) under [In-Network-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/In-Network-Machine-Learning).** Planter paper will appear in the next volume of CCR [[pdf](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/media/zetja3ek/zheng24planter.pdf)]. Meanwhile, if you're interested in this work and find anything unclear in the ArXiv paper, please feel free to contact me at ```changgang.zheng@eng.ox.ac.uk```. **We are welcoming collaborations.** It can be exciting to collaborate, if you think in-network machine learning is helpful to your research or use case. If there are any potential interests, please feel free to contact my supervisor ```noa.zilberman@eng.ox.ac.uk``` and me ```changgang.zheng@eng.ox.ac.uk```.
